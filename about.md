Currently, DevOps is more like a philosophical movement, not yet a precise collection of practices, descriptive or prescriptive - Gene Kim

My name is Juan Carlos, born in Granada, grown in Tenerife (Canary
Islands) and now living in Tenerife after a period abroad, where I'm surfing the wave of DevOps
in this tech ocean, surronded by top-notch professionals and
enjoying this new world of opportunities. Computer Engineer says my CV,
but I labelled myself as _problem solver_: whatever the challenge is I'll solve it!

Please feel free to contact me if you think I have a typo, error or you
have any suggestion, we are here to learn and enjoy ;) Many thanks!
