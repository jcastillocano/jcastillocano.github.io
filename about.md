Currently, DevOps is more like a philosophical movement, not yet a precise collection of practices, descriptive or prescriptive - Gene Kim

My name is Juan Carlos, born in Granada, grown in Tenerife (Canary
Islands) and now living in London, where I'm surfing the wave of DevOps
in this tech ocean called *The City*, surronded by top-notch professionals and
enjoying this new world of opportunities. Computer Engineer say my CV,
but I tag myself as _problem solver_: I don't care if you have to deal with
Cloud providers, Raspberry, washing machine or a roof, whatever the challenge is I'll solve it!

Please feel free to contact me if you think I have a typo, error or you
have any suggestion, we are here to learn and enjoy ;)
