## Around Config Management Camp 2019

This is my very first time at [FOSDEM][fosdem], although I've been following it since a while ago (thanks FOSDEM fellas for streaming 
all the main talks!). This year I had the chance to come thanks to my current employeer [System73][system73] alongside some
coworkers. Main target this year for me was Infrastructure, Monitoring and Testing talks, and I have plenty of them (as reach
talks, offline chats or even just following links from some slides). Here are my take overs. 

## Observability

* TODO: Observability for emerging infra: what got you here won't get you there
https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/keynote0/

![Deployments](/deployments.jpeg)

* TODO: Drilling down a software bug: lessons about observability, monitoring, automation and good practices
https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/drilling/

![Best Practices](/bestpractices.jpeg)

## Unikernels

* TODO: Configuration and configuration management with Unikernels
https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/unikernels/

## Stream Processing

* TODO: Solving large scale operational metadata problems using stream processing
https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/metastreamprocess/

## Istio

* TODO: Istio: Control and Observability for Microservices
https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/istioobserve/

better to follow docs 

## Testing

* [What did you InSpec][whatdidyouinspec]

TIP: Use for docker images and databases too
TIP2: Use `inspec shell` to validate your tests

* Jenkins/Packer/Inspec/Terraform to bake and test AWS AMIs
