I've been dealing with github for a while, in both enterprise and github versions, and I told me to try some day this awesome feature called `github pages`. So here I am, writing my first entry as a welcome post.

My name is Juan Carlos [about me][about], known in github as @jcastillocano, and I would define myself as a passionate engineer, problem solver and nice guy in general (why not). My journey began almost 17 years ago, when I had to rebuild from scratch my *brand new Pentium I* (snif) because no one else at home knew how to operate this poor thing. Since then, a lot of machines, datacenters and clouds have suffered my wrath and fury, but no one has ever complained (ask me about some providers, and I'll tell you nice horror stories...)

I use to contribute back to most of the repos I use in my daily basics, but I also own some pet projects on my profile [Github repo][jcastillocano-gh]: python, ruby, crazy bash... and growing! Please check them out and send me some pull requests!

Thanks for spending your time in this last corner of Internet, see you around :)
